        <h1>Welcome to the Home page</h1>

        Hello, my name is Emma and welcome to my page. Here you will learn a bit about me.

        <h2>Biography</h2>

        I was born in Kentucky, but moved with my family to Mount Pleasant, Iowa when I was 9. I've lived in Iowa ever
        since! I graduated from Mount Pleasant Community High School, where I was active in band, choir, and theatre as
        well as taking several AP classes.

        <h2>Education</h2>

        In 2013, I graduated from Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa. I majored in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
        and graduated with a 3.5 GPA. I remained in band and choir throughout choir, and was involved in a sorority,
        Beta Psi Eta.

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>

        After graduating college, I worked for about two years for Roquette America Inc, where my job was performing
        quality control testing on high fructose corn syrup and dextrose. After that, I was able to get a job with the
        University of Iowa Pharmaceuticals. In this role, I performed quality control testing as well as other studies
        on pharmaceutical drug products. Most of these were in various stages of clinical research. I was in this
        position for eight years before I changed fields to pursure computer science.

        <h2>Goals</h2>

        Since pursuing a career change, my new goal is to complete the coding program throuhg DeltaV Code School, then
        get a job as a developer. At this stage, I don't know what kind of company I would most like to work for. I
        enjoy creative pursuits such as music and art, but I also have a great deal of experience in the biological and
        chemical sciences and would be interested in working for a pharmaceutical company.

        <h2>Interests</h2>

        In my free time, I enjoy making digital art, playing the piano, and I am writing a fantasy novel. I have an
        amazing husband, Drew, as well as two cats and a dog.
